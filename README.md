## Ruby Basics & Enumerables (meets Beauty and the Beast)

### Question 1

Define a method called `offer_rose`, which should take one argument named `person`.

When called the method should `puts` "Would you take this rose, `person`, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?"

Demonstrate calling the method, passing in "young prince" as the argument.

Write your code here:
```ruby
# code here
```

### Question 2

Assume the following hash:

```ruby
town = {
  residents: ["Maurice", "Belle", "Gaston"],
  castle: {
    num_rooms: 47,
    residents: "Robby Benson",
    guests: []
  }
}
```

Using Ruby, remove Belle from the town residents, and
add her to the list of guests in the castle.

Write your code here:
```ruby
# code here
```

### Question 3

Assume you have an array of strings representing friend's names:

```ruby
friends = ["Chip Potts", "Cogsworth", "Lumière", "Mrs. Potts"]
```

Using `.each` AND string interpolation, produce output (using `puts`) like so:

```
Belle is friends with Chip Potts
Belle is friends with Cogsworth
Belle is friends with Lumière
Belle is friends with Mrs. Potts
```

Write your code here:
```ruby
# code here
```
## Ruby OOP (meets Lion King)

### Question 4

Create ruby classes for `Animal` and `Lion`.
Each `Animal` should have:

- a `name` attribute
- a `greet` instance method
- Getter and setter for `name`

Make the `Lion` inherit from the `Animal` class.
The `Lion` class should have a `pack` class variable that holds references to each instance created.

Each lion should have:
- a `king` attribute which is a boolean
  - If the instance's `name` is `Simba` make the `king` attribute true

```ruby
# code here
```

## SQL, Databases, and ActiveRecord (meets Aladdin)

### Question 5

Describe what an ERD is, and why we create them for applications. Also give an
example what the attributes and relationships might be for the following
entities (no need to draw an ERD):
* Genie
* Lamp
* Person
* Pet

Your answer:
```
Replace this with your answer
```

### Question 6

Describe what a schema is, and how we represent a one-to-many relationship in a
SQL database. If you need an example, you can use: people and wishes
(one-to-many).

Your answer:
```
Replace this with your answer
```
## Bonus

### Question 7

**Assume:**  

1. Your database two working tables, `genies` and `lamps`.  
2. You have a working connection to the database for ActiveRecord.  
3. You have active record models defined for `Genie` and `Lamp`, and the
relationships between the two are set up in Active Record.  
4. Lamps have one property, `wishes_remaining`, and genies have one property, `name`.  

**Write code to do the following:**

1. Create a lamp with 3 wishes remaining and a genie named 'Genie'
2. Create a relationship between 'Genie' and the lamp.
3. Update the lamp so it only has one wish left.
  * Oh no... Jafar has Aladdin! Thankfully he's wished to become a genie himself!
4. Create a new Genie named 'Jafar' and put him in a new lamp with 3 wishes left.
5. Free the good Genie by setting his lamp to `nil`
